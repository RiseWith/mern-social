# Mern-Social Project

The goal of this project is show up a social media applicaction with some feature using React with base for the FrontEnd.

In this project I use the [mern-skeleton](https://github.com/diogenesdauster/mern-skeleton) with template, because I've already made the init configuration of MERN stack.
